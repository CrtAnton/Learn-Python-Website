    <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Introduction to Lists</h2>
        <p>In Python, a list is one of the most versatile and widely used data structures. It is used to store an ordered collection of items, which can be of any type. Lists are mutable, which means that the values inside a list can be changed after its creation.</p>

        <h2>Creating Lists</h2>
        <p>Lists are created by placing a comma-separated sequence of items inside square brackets <code>[]</code>. Items can be of heterogeneous types, meaning you can combine strings, numbers, and other lists within a list.</p>
        <pre><code>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed_list = [1, "apple", [3, 4, 5]]</code></pre>

        <h2>Accessing Elements</h2>
        <p>You can access individual elements of a list using indexing. Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first item is indexed as 0, the second item as 1, and so on. Negative indexing starts from the end of the list: -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item, and so on.</p>
        <pre><code>print(fruits[1])   # Outputs: banana
print(numbers[-1])  # Outputs: 5</code></pre>

        <h2>Manipulating Lists</h2>
        <p>Being mutable, lists in Python can be altered after their creation. You can add, remove, or modify items after the list has been defined.</p>

        <h3>Adding Elements</h3>
        <p>There are multiple ways to add elements to a list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>append:</strong> Adds an item to the end of the list.</li>
            <li><strong>insert:</strong> Inserts an item at a given position.</li>
            <li><strong>extend:</strong> Adds multiple items from another list or iterable.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code>fruits.append("grape")
fruits.insert(1, "orange")
fruits.extend(["kiwi", "mango"])</code></pre>

        <h3>Removing Elements</h3>
        <p>Similarly, there are various methods to remove items from a list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>remove:</strong> Removes the first occurrence of an item.</li>
            <li><strong>pop:</strong> Removes the item at a specific index and returns it. By default, it removes the last item.</li>
            <li><strong>del:</strong> Removes the item at a specific index.</li>
            <li><strong>clear:</strong> Removes all items from the list.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Useful Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>sort:</strong> Sorts the items of the list in place.</li>
            <li><strong>count:</strong> Returns the number of times a particular element appears in the list.</li>
            <li><strong>index:</strong> Returns the index of the first occurrence of an item in the list.</li>
            <li><strong>reverse:</strong> Reverses the items of the list in place.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>List Comprehension</h2>
        <p>List comprehension offers a shorter and more readable way to create lists. It is Python's way of implementing a well-known notation for sets as used in mathematics. It can be used to construct lists in a very natural, easy way, similar to how mathematicians describe sets.</p>
        <pre><code>squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]</code></pre>
        <p>This will generate a list of squares for numbers from 0 to 9.</p>

        <h2>Benefits and Use-Cases of Lists</h2>
        <p>Lists are extremely versatile and can be used in a variety of situations. They are perfect for maintaining ordered collections of items, be it for data analysis, web development, or even game development. Their mutable nature, coupled with Python's built-in list methods, makes them ideal for data manipulation tasks.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Python lists are an essential data structure, and understanding them is crucial for anyone looking to become proficient in Python. Their flexibility and wide range of built-in methods make them indispensable for many programming tasks.</p>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10 and use list comprehension to generate a new list containing the square of each number.</li>
            <li>Given a list of strings, generate a new list that contains only those strings that start with the letter 'a'.</li>
            <li>Write a function that takes a list and returns a new list with duplicate values removed.</li>
            <li>Find the intersection of two lists, meaning the elements that are common in both lists.</li>
            <li>Using a list comprehension, generate a list of numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 5.</li>
        </ol>
