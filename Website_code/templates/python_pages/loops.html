    <h1>Loops</h1>

    <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Introduction to Loops</h2>
        <p>Loops are one of the fundamental concepts in programming. They allow for a set of instructions to be executed repeatedly based on a condition or an iterable. This repetitive execution is beneficial for tasks that require the same action to be taken multiple times, such as iterating through lists, performing calculations on series of numbers, or repeatedly prompting a user for input.</p>

        <h2>While Loop</h2>
        <p>The <code>while</code> loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to <code>True</code>. It's akin to saying "while this condition is true, keep doing these tasks".</p>
        <pre><code>count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1</code></pre>
        <p>This loop will print numbers from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>5</strong>. It's essential to modify the loop control variable inside the loop to avoid infinite loops.</p>

        <h2>For Loop</h2>
        <p>The <code>for</code> loop in Python is primarily used to iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, and ranges. Instead of iterating while a condition is true, the <code>for</code> loop iterates over every item in a sequence.</p>
        <pre><code>for i in range(5):
    print(i)</code></pre>
        <p>This loop will print numbers from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>4</strong>. The range function generates a sequence of numbers which the <code>for</code> loop then iterates over.</p>

        <h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>
        <p>Control statements change the execution of loops from its normal sequence. The primary loop control statements are <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, and <code>pass</code>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>break:</strong> Terminates the loop and transfers execution to the next statement after the loop.</li>
            <li><strong>continue:</strong> Causes the loop to skip the rest of its body for the current iteration and jump to the next iteration.</li>
            <li><strong>pass:</strong> A null operation; nothing happens when it's executed. It's useful as a placeholder when syntax requires a statement but no action is needed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Nested Loops</h2>
        <p>A loop inside another loop is termed as a nested loop. The inner loop will be performed one time for each iteration of the outer loop.</p>
        <pre><code>for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        print(i, j)</code></pre>
        <p>This nested loop will produce pairs of numbers: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), and so on.</p>

        <h2>Looping Techniques in Python</h2>
        <p>Python provides several built-in functions and constructs that enhance looping capabilities. Functions like <code>enumerate()</code>, <code>zip()</code>, and constructs like "list comprehensions" provide more flexibility and efficiency in loops.</p>

        <h2>The Importance of Efficient Looping</h2>
        <p>Loops can significantly affect the performance of the program. Iterating unnecessarily, not utilizing Python's built-in functions, or not optimizing loops can lead to slower program execution. It's crucial to ensure loops are efficient, especially when handling large data sets or performing complex calculations.</p>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Write a <code>while</code> loop that prints even numbers from 2 to 10.</li>
            <li>Use a <code>for</code> loop to iterate over a list of strings and print each string's length.</li>
            <li>Implement a nested loop to generate multiplication tables for numbers 1 to 3.</li>
            <li>Create a <code>for</code> loop that uses the <code>continue</code> statement to print all numbers from 1 to 10, but skips the number 5.</li>
            <li>Use a <code>for</code> loop and the <code>enumerate()</code> function to iterate over a list of colors and print each color's index and value.</li>
