    <h1>Learning SQL Fundamentals</h1>

    <h2>Understanding SQL Queries</h2>
    <p>SQL queries are used to retrieve specific data from a database. They allow you to interact with the database by instructing it to retrieve, filter, and order data based on your requirements. Let's break down the key components of a SQL query:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>SELECT</code> Clause: Specifies which columns you want to retrieve from a table.</li>
        <li><code>FROM</code> Clause: Specifies the table from which you're retrieving data.</li>
        <li><code>WHERE</code> Clause: Filters data based on specific conditions.</li>
        <li><code>ORDER BY</code> Clause: Sorts the results in ascending or descending order.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Writing Simple Queries</h2>
    <p>Consider a hypothetical database with a table named "Employees." This table contains information about employees in a company, including columns like "EmployeeID," "FirstName," "LastName," "Department," and "Salary."</p>

    <h3>Example 1: Retrieve All Employee Names</h3>
    <p>To retrieve the first and last names of all employees:</p>
    <code>
        SELECT FirstName, LastName<br>
        FROM Employees;
    </code>

    <h3>Example 2: Filter Employees by Department</h3>
    <p>To retrieve employees from the "Sales" department:</p>
    <code>
        SELECT FirstName, LastName<br>
        FROM Employees<br>
        WHERE Department = 'Sales';
    </code>

    <h3>Example 3: Sorting Employees by Salary</h3>
    <p>To retrieve employees sorted by salary in descending order:</p>
    <code>
        SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary<br>
        FROM Employees<br>
        ORDER BY Salary DESC;
    </code>

    <h2>Exercises: Practice Your Skills</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Retrieve the names of all employees who have a salary greater than $50,000.</li>
        <li>Retrieve the first name, last name, and department of employees from the "Marketing" department.</li>
        <li>Retrieve the names of employees and their salaries, ordered by salary in ascending order.</li>
        <li>Retrieve the first name, last name, and department of employees with IDs 101 and 105.</li>
        <li>Retrieve the first name and last name of employees whose last name starts with the letter "S".</li>
    </ol>
