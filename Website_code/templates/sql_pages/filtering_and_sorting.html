    <h1>Mastering Filtering, Sorting, and Combining Conditions in SQL</h1>

    <p>Filtering and sorting data are essential skills when working with databases. In this lesson, we'll delve into the world of SQL operators and wildcards, teaching you how to filter data effectively, combine conditions using logical operators, and sort query results for better readability.</p>

    <h2>Filtering Data with Comparison Operators and Wildcards</h2>
    <p>Comparison operators allow you to compare values and make decisions based on the results. SQL supports common comparison operators such as <code>=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>&lt;=</code>. Additionally, wildcards like <code>%</code> and <code>_</code> are used in combination with the <code>LIKE</code> operator to match patterns within strings.</p>

    <h3>Example: Filtering Using Comparison Operators</h3>
    <p>Suppose you have an "Employees" table with a "Salary" column. To retrieve employees with a salary greater than $50,000:</p>
    <code>
        SELECT FirstName, LastName<br>
        FROM Employees<br>
        WHERE Salary &gt; 50000;
    </code>

    <h3>Example: Filtering Using Wildcards</h3>
    <p>Imagine you have a "Customers" table with an "Email" column. To retrieve customers with Gmail addresses:</p>
    <code>
        SELECT FirstName, LastName<br>
        FROM Customers<br>
        WHERE Email LIKE '%@gmail.com';
    </code>

    <h2>Combining Conditions with Logical Operators</h2>
    <p>Logical operators (<code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, <code>NOT</code>) help you create complex conditions by combining multiple filters.</p>

    <h3>Example: Combining Conditions with AND and OR</h3>
    <code>
        SELECT FirstName, LastName<br>
        FROM Employees<br>
        WHERE Department = 'Sales'<br>
        AND Salary &gt; 60000;
    </code>

    <h2>Sorting Query Results with ORDER BY</h2>
    <p>The <code>ORDER BY</code> clause is used to sort query results in ascending (<code>ASC</code>) or descending (<code>DESC</code>) order.</p>
    <code>
        SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary<br>
        FROM Employees<br>
        ORDER BY Salary DESC;
    </code>

    <h2>Exercises: Practice Your Skills</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Retrieve books with titles starting with the letter "A."</li>
        <li>Retrieve customers whose first name is "John" or last name is "Doe."</li>
        <li>Retrieve employees from the "HR" department with a salary less than $50,000.</li>
        <li>Retrieve customers who have a Gmail address and are from the "Marketing" department.</li>
        <li>Retrieve employees sorted by department in ascending order and then by salary in descending order.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Exercise Solutions:</h2>
    <code>
        1. SELECT Title<br>
        &emsp;FROM Books<br>
        &emsp;WHERE Title LIKE 'A%';<br><br>

        2. SELECT FirstName, LastName<br>
        &emsp;FROM Customers<br>
        &emsp;WHERE FirstName = 'John' OR LastName = 'Doe';<br><br>

        3. SELECT FirstName, LastName<br>
        &emsp;FROM Employees<br>
        &emsp;WHERE Department = 'HR' AND Salary < 50000;<br><br>

        4. SELECT FirstName, LastName<br>
        &emsp;FROM Customers<br>
        &emsp;WHERE Email LIKE '%@gmail.com' AND Department = 'Marketing';<br><br>

        5. SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary<br>
        &emsp;FROM Employees<br>
        &emsp;ORDER BY Department ASC, Salary DESC;
    </code>
